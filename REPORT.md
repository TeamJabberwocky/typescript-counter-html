# JS Framework Comparative Analysis

## TypeScript

### Research Conducted By: Aileen Murphy, Joseph Hangarter, Brad Smialek

### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 9
#### General Comments
* Examples dont compile
* Just like Javascript but stricter; types are declared up front hence TypeScript

#### Pros
* Very similar to JavaScript, and act similarly
* No surpises with data types due to declaration
* Errors are caught when compiling

#### Cons
* It's not a natural language for browser, and must be compiled before shipment -- this also slows workflow
* It can compile weird
* Although it's similar to JS, it takes a minute to warm up to it
* It slows workflow 

### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
* In order to use TypeScript, first install it `npm install -g typescript`
* Open editor, and make sure to name your file with `.ts` extension
* Once you've finished editing, compile by utilizing `tsc <filename>.ts`. This will compile your work into a JS file which can be read by the browsers

#### Systems Requirements
* Node.js, Visual Studio Code (and select others)

#### Ramp-Up Projections
* There is a small learning curve to acclimate otherwise projections would be the same as JS with minor troubleshooting

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
* Even though there are not a lot of people using TypeScript, it is still on the rise.
How popular is this framework? What big companies are running on it? How is it "seen" in the general JS community?  Is there an active community of developers supporting and growing it?
